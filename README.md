# AI-Resume-Classifier-Job-Matcher
“This project demonstrates my ability to build an explainable AI-based resume analysis system using Python, NLP, and machine learning, with section-wise matching, skill gap detection, ATS scoring, and a deployed web interface.”

# 📄 AI Resume Classifier & Job Matcher

## 📌 Project Overview
The AI Resume Classifier & Job Matcher is an AI-powered web application that analyzes a candidate’s resume and compares it with a given job description.
The system performs section-wise resume analysis, highlights skill gaps, generates AI-based feedback, and calculates an ATS compatibility score.
